**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm using Iris Dataset**

Welcome to the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of the KNN algorithm using the famous Iris dataset.

**Overview**
The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective classification algorithm that classifies a new data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors. In this repository, we explore the KNN algorithm using the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning.


The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective classification algorithm that classifies a new data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors. In this repository, we explore the KNN algorithm using the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning.
he Iris dataset contains measurements of various iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with their corresponding species. The dataset consists of 150 samples, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.
